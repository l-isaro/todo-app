1. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your current directory to the project directory.
3. Access the Application: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost to access the To-Do List application


## **Assumptions and Decisions**

Base Image: The Dockerfile uses the httpd:2.4 image as the base, which is a lightweight Apache HTTP Server image. This choice was made for its simplicity and compatibility with web applications.
Working Directory: The working directory is set to /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ to align with the default document root of the Apache server.
